								<h1>FP Du Toit Transport supports Red Cross Draught Relief Program</h1>
								<div class="post-content">
									<p>The Namibian Competition Commission on 21 April 2015, after an unfortunate delay of more than four months,
										approved one of the largest mergers of transportation companies in Namibian history. </p>
									<p>Mr Willie du Toit the Managing Director of F P du Toit Transport (Pty) Ltd yesterday announced that his company
										has bought the business of Wesbank Transport (Pty) Ltd</p>
									<p>As a going concern together with all its assets, contracts and the Wesbank Transport brand name. F P du Toit
										Transport will offer new employment contracts to virtually the total staff compliment of approximately 360 people
										currently employed by Wesbank Transport.. </p>
									<p> </p>
									<p>Both companies were founded in the middle sixties of the previous century, F P du Toit Transport by Mr Maans du
										Toit in the Northern Cape and Wesbank Transport by Mr E P van Rooyen in Walvis Bay. F P du Toit Transport moved
										their total operation to Namibia in 1970. Both companies have been family owned and managed since inception. The
										Van Rooyen family has taken the decision to sell because Mr E P van Rooyen has now reached the ripe old age of 92
										years and his son Mr Melvyn van Rooyen, the erstwhile Managing Director of Wesbank Transport, passed away some four
										years ago while the other son, Mr Veon van Rooyen, do not wish to manage the company on his own. Mr du Toit wished
										them all a happy retirement. “They left a deep footprint for others to follow” he said </p>
									<p>The respective companies are both leaders in their fields of operation. F P du Toit Transport has for many years
										already been the largest logistics service provider in Namibia with its main focus areas in long haul
										transportation active in nine SADC countries, distribution services for the retail, automotive, industrial and
										pharmaceutical sectors and a courier division rendering overnight express services from and to South Africa and a
										daily domestic footprint in Namibia to larger destinations and servicing even the smallest communities at least
										twice a week. Wesbank Transport’s main fields of operation are in the mining industry where they proudly hold
										transportation contracts with all the operating Uranium mines in the Erongo region. They are the largest harbour
										carrier and container handling and storage facility operator in Walvis Bay, owns the largest abnormal loads
										division in Namibia and a crane hire business owning the largest cranes in the country with up to 220 tons
										capacity. The company also supply full </p>
									<p>loads and break bulk consolidation services to commercial and industrial enterprises situated mainly in the
										coastal areas. Both companies also have branches in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban. </p>
									<p>Mr du Toit said that it was this diversity of operations that made the Wesbank business attractive to his company.
										“We can now with confidence say that we can offer the whole bouquet of logistical services to our customers, the
										only true “one-stop-shop” in logistics in Namibia. We can now offer services ranging from the global pick up or
										delivery of an envelope to the heaviest piece of machinery and handle all customs clearing and forwarding services
										in-house. </p>

									<div class="clearfix"></div>
									<p>Mr Van Rooyen expressed his gratitude that his company, together with its staff, many with long service awards and
										who became part of the family through the years, will remain in Namibian hands and will not be swallowed up by a
										multinational conglomerate. The present Wesbank Transport management will remain largely intact under the able
										leadership of Mr Willem Pronk, the erstwhile CEO of the company, now reporting as the COO of the Wesbank division
										of FP du Toit Transport directly to Mr du Toit while Mr Dirkie Uys, the long servicing COO of F P du Toit Transport
										will look after the present operations of the company. </p>
									<p>The combined transportation company will in future employ in excess of one thousand people, whilst the Intracom
										Group, the holding company of the Du Toit group of companies, who also has a large hospitality and tourism division
										under the name of Taleni Africa Tourism Holdings, will now become one of the larger employers in the country with
										less than one percent non Namibian citizens employed. </p>
									<p>Wesbank Transport, whilst being an operating division of F P du Toit Transport, will retain the trade name of
										Wesbank Transport, because many years of customer loyalty has made it a very valuable trade mark. The combined
										company will now operate a fleet of well in excess of three hundred and fifty self-propelled vehicles and pieces of
										heavy equipment together with even more trailers and specialized equipment, which makes it one of the larger
										players in the SADC region. Mr Du Toit gave the assurance that it will remain “business as usual” for Wesbank
										Transport’s customers and staff whilst benefitting from the advanced level of ITC systems, synergies, knowhow and
										the forward thinking culture developed over many years by the Du Toit group. He jokingly said the largest visible
										change will be the colour of the vehicles which will shortly starting to sport the distinctive green and white
										livery of the Du Toit group. </p>
									<p>He also thanked the Namibian Government for their insight and demonstrated vision to make Namibia one of the
										largest and most effective logistics hubs in Southern Africa. He is very excited about the massive expansion of the
										Walvis Bay port which is currently under construction and pledged his commitment to supply the supporting logistic
										services for bringing this Namibian dream to reality. He also yesterday expressed his delight with the contents of
										the State of the Nation address delivered on the same day in Parliament by His Excellency Dr Hage Geingob, the
										President of the Republic of Namibia. “With such a leader in command I have no doubt that we will attain and even
										exceed our National Goals. The President can rest assured that my Board under the able Chairmanship of Mr Francois
										Uys, our people and I will contribute our humble part in achieving that”, he said. </p>
									<p>He also expressed his gratitude to the Namibian financial sector who was able to facilitate in entirety the
										financial aspects of this deal led by Bank Windhoek. Independent financial experts classify this transaction,
										inclusive of a very large property transaction which form part and parcel of the transaction, as one of the largest
										Namibian to Namibian enterprises sale in the history of the country. </p>
									<p>We can now proudly adopt the slogan “Made and Financed in Namibia by Namibians” he concluded.</p>
