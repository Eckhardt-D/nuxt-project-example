								<h1>If you Don't Have a Dream</h1>
								<div class="post-content">
									<p>For a long time this Namibian brand dreamt of a purpose-built new depot in Johannesburg. Not only because that's where the business is – “we simply wanted to offer our clients a centralized and even more effective service than what they've become used to”</p>
									<p>7 November was an auspicious day. Not only did it mark the day of the opening of their new state of the art facility, 7 November 2012 also happened to be the 96th birthday of Frans and Willie du Toit's mother, which was more than a good reason for this facility to be named after her - the Gerrie du Toit Depot. She is, after all, the wife of the late Maans du Toit, founder of the company, and the proverbial "strong woman found behind every successful man”.</p>
									<div class="clearfix"></div>
										<p>“It has taken us 44 years to get here, but like all good things it was worth the wait.” The Gerrie du Toit Depot was
											designed as eco-friendly possible within the constraints and challenges of an industrial building. Rain water is
											harvested from its roofs and stored in 7 x 10 000 liter tanks for use in washrooms as well as serving the air
											conditioning system; run-off rain water from the large paved areas is stored in a 600 000 liter underground concrete
											reservoir to be used for the washing of vehicles; the “plaas koeler” air conditioning system used in the warehouse
											and workshop areas each feature only one electric motor for air distribution; with no other moving parts it works on
											the same cooling principle - through evaporation - as the systems used on farms for many decades before electricity
											was available; in winter time the the air conditioning flow can be reversed to harvest hot air from under the
											building's roofs and distributed to offices for heating purposes; once agreement with Ukurhuleni Metro Council has
											been reached for “grid-in–feeding” of electricity the roof areas will be covered with PV solar panels to generate
											enough electricity for own use and the lush gardens irrigated from solar pump driven bore holes. “Our aim is to be as
											independent from municipal services possible so to lighten our environmental foot print” says Managing Director
											Willie du Toit. When measured against present and announced future increases in municipal services, his calculations
											show the investment in environmental friendly measures will have paid for itself in less than four years!
											If you don’t have a dream, you won’t have a dream come true.</p>
