								<h4>Cross Border</h4>
								<p>Courier freight is received in Windhoek from CapeTown and Johannesburg Monday to Saturday using multiple departures.  
                  The cross border route from Johannesburg is serviced with a minimum of 3 vehicles; but regularly 5 vehicles are operated daily.  
                  This includes a 36 ton SpeedLink Taut-liner with 2 driver; driving non-stop to Windhoek; a 12 ton vehicle with the flexibility to attach a trailer;
                   a 8 ton vehicle and 1 or even 2 small express vehicles who can leave from 19:00 to arrive the next day, late morning.  
                   With the added advantage of having Namibian customs officers on our premises; we save time by not waiting in queues at border crossings.  
                   In order to achieve better efficiencies, custom documents are flown to Windhoek from Cape Town and Johannesburg to arrive before the vehicle. 
                   The processing of the importation of the goods can be started before the vehicle’s arrival.</p>
